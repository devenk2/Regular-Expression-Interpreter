# Regular Expression Interpreter

Author: Deven Kumar

This is a project I worked on in school. The files nfa.ml and regexp.ml are the ones I wrote, the others were provided.

nfa.ml:
This file contains code that converts an NFA to a DFA. It also contains various helper functions to aid in the process.

regexp.ml
This file contains code that converts a regular expression to an NFA. It also contains various helper methods.

For more details on the project, the project guidelines are attached.
