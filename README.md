# Regular-Expression-Interpreter

Author: Deven Kumar

This is a project I worked on in school. The files nfa.ml and regexp.ml are the ones I wrote, the others were provided to us. It is written in OCaml

nfa.ml:
This file contains code that takes an NFA and converts it to a DFA. It also contains a lot of helper functions to assist with this.

regexp.ml:
This file contains code that converts a regular expression into an NFA. It also contains multiple helper methods.

For more information, the project guidelines are attached.
